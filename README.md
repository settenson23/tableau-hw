Analysis for Tableau Homework-

Based off the data from the map I created, a majority of the stations seem to be located on Manhattan and the most popular of those stations seem to be in the middle of the island. This would make sense as that is where a majority of the things to in Manhattan are located.

Probably the most surprising aspect when analyzing rider duration by starting station was how much farther people tend to ride from the Madison St & Forest Ave location. The average duration from that location is also 5 times as far as any other starting station. While only 52 people starting from this location in February 2020, they definetely wanted to travel somewhere far away. 

Something that stood about when analyzing which days had the most rides was that the most seem to have happened on Wednesdays which surprised me. There was also more rides during the week than on weekends, which probably means people used these bikes to go to work and back home. Given that the most popular times of the day to ride are 5:00 pm, 6:00 pm, 8:00 am, 4:00 pm, and 9:00 am, this would definetely make sense for people to use going to and from work. 

There tends to be a lot more younger people who use Citi Bikes than older people. Younger people also take longer trips than older poeple. 

Pershing Square North being the most popular station by starting and leaving makes sense given the station is right next to the Grand Central Terminal.
